# animated-loading-ui-example

- This JavaScript project aims to create a simple "loading" effect that visually tracks the loading process of a web page. Two key elements on the page, namely the loading text (loadText) and the background (bg), are employed for this purpose. The project updates the loading percentage and the background blur through the bluring function, which is called at regular intervals.
